      I love to do something new, i love to creating new things but it took a lot of time from my life to realise what i actually love to do. Sometime i love to live alone , but not everytime, i love to spent time with positive people and i always love to be loved by people and i also love to love people. i love my mother and my family.i have a lot of dreams , don't know if its possible to fulfill all my dreams in this uncertain life. <br/>
      i never was a serious or a talented student ever, but i always love to do what i enjoy, if i enjoy any course or anythig i can give my best here.To make enjoy any course for a student there is a great role of a teacher, i'm really greatfull to some of my university teachers which i never can express.Also in my learning i took help from so many online sources. i love a youtube channel for CSE students, which helped me a lot and i always suggest everyone to follow this channel. You Can Visit The Channel-
